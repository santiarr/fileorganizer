# fileorganizer
Organizes the files in you file explorer into specified folders


# Using the software
- First you need to specify the paths of the directories that you want to be organized
- The code works by using a dictionary to store folder names along with the file types you want to be stored in them
- After customizing these fields you can run the app and see how quickly everythin gets sorted!

# Future updates
- I plan on making a GUI for this app so that you wouldn't have to edit the source code in order to have the program work
- I also plan on making it so that it runs in the background and automatically sorts new files
